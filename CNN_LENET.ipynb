        "The basic units in each convolutional block are a convolutional layer, a sigmoid activation function, and a subsequent average pooling operation.\n",

        "\n",
        "These layers map spatially arranged inputs to a number of two-dimensional feature maps, typically increasing the number of channels. The first convolutional layer has 6 output channels, while the second has 16. Each  pooling operation (stride 2) reduces dimensionality by a factor of  via spatial downsampling. The convolutional block emits an output with shape given by (batch size, number of channel, height, width).\n",

LeNet's dense block has three fully-connected layers, with 120, 84, and 10 outputs, respectively. Because we are still performing classification, the 10-dimensional output layer corresponds to the number of possible output classes.\n",

We need only to instantiate a Sequential block and chain together the appropriate layers."

The first convolutional layer uses 2 pixels of padding to compensate for the reduction in height and width that would otherwise result from using a  kernel. In contrast, the second convolutional layer forgoes padding, and thus the height and width are both reduced by 4 pixels. As we go up the stack of layers, the number of channels increases layer-over-layer from 1 in the input to 6 after the first convolutional layer and 16 after the second convolutional layer. However, each pooling layer halves the height and width. Finally, each fully-connected layer reduces dimensionality, finally emitting an output whose dimension matches the number of classes.\n",
